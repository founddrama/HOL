title: House of Leaves- Chapter XIV
---

[friesel](http://blog.founddrama.net/) writ:

7/8 - XIV.

(Karen's affair w/ Fowler)

@todo - "der absoluten Zerrissenheit" (pp. 310)
<br/> - no trans. fr/ Kyrie (Truant) but curiously none fr/ Ed. either (at this time)

<hr/>

*side bar:* re: "Truant is Zampanò (there is no Zampanò)"
<br/> - just like there is no Truant (not really?)
<br/> - &amp; so what we have here is a sub-text about our relationship w/ fiction and/or our relationship w/ the author (and/or his/her authority?)
