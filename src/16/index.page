7/9 - XVI.

*SCIENCE*

@ opening epigraph - Einstein on science's frailty

so much is <span style="background-color:black;color:#222222;padding:2px;">inked out</span>

*SIDE NOTE:* 
<br/>- why does <s>Zampan√≤</s> Truant (Danielewski?) "<span style="background-color:black;color:#222222;padding:2px;">ink out</span>" so much of this chapter?
<br/>- &amp; then why leave any clues at all?
<br/>- more on "authorial authority" -- @todo - speculate ?

* significance of orphaned footnotes? (&amp; Truant's ink accident? [the only tattooing he'll ever do?])

* impossibly old samples (older than the Earth? older than the Solar System?)
