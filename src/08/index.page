(it's _not_ odd why Navidson arranges the shot[s] of Exploration 4 that way [i.e., all on Reston] -- it's a slap in the face to Holloway -- if it's unfilmable down there then let's not try to film it @ all -- &amp; instead _overfilm_ Reston -- basically stationary etc. anyway -- and _overfilm_ w/r/t/ camera, lens, film speed, everything)

<span style="border:1px solid #0000ee;">SOS</span> -- knocking

(pp. 102) 2nd mention of _Delial_
