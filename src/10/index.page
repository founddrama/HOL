7/5 - X.

Navidson et al. on a rescue mission

/drastically impossibly comically obscenely shorter staircase

a note on the textual orientation : tops are TOM (and/or The Narrative?) / bottoms are Navy @staircase bottom

(pp. 188) Navy &amp; Reston discover a one-of-a-kind -- door w/o a doorknob (&amp; locked, to boot) {and/but -- wasn't there some long bit in [Ch.IX](/fun/HOL/09/) about how _featureless_ everything was? -- doesn't this contradict that just a little? and/or wouldn't the style of the doorknob(s) be of critical importance?}
	@todo - speculate on the doorknobs and their style








<div align="right" style="margin:20px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #0000ee;">
	It occurs to me now that many of the footnotes in (esp. [exclusively?] in <a href="/fun/HOL/09">Ch.IX</a>) are marked w/ Ground-Air Emergency Code sigils // &amp; probably should be considered in light of those sigils &amp; their <s>implied</s> ascribed meaning(s) 
	
	how do those sigils change the meanings of the footnotes?
