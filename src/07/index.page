title: House of Leaves- Chapter VII
---

[friesel](http://blog.founddrama.net/) writ:

7/4 - VII.

Holloway et al. on the scene 
	- guns
	- aggression 

*occurs to me:* many of the footnotes are little more than red-herrings &amp; dead-ends (the footnotes _are_ the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span>?) &amp; at best they are echoes
	- echoes in the [Chapter V](/fun/HOL/05/) sense (repetition, re-telling) 

@todo - tenebrific ?
