Chad's drawing:<br/>
<div style="width:400px;height:400px;padding:0.5%;border:1px solid #0000ee;"><div style="width:100%;height:100%;background:black;">&nbsp;</div></div><br/>
(Daisy draws the same <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span>)

<div align="right" style="width:50%;padding:20px;margin-left:50%;border:1px dashed #0000ee;">
	side note : animals ("creatures") in the margin(s) of Chad's <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> drawing - includes a tiger (definitely; definitely one of Karen's Feng Shui guardians) -- the creatures in Chad's drawings _aren't_ monsters? (the "wolf" is Hillary? the tiger + dragon are Karen's Feng Shui guardians?)
</div>

re: Chad - Truant's own play yard scuffles? (Johnny as Chad as Johnny?)
<br/>see also: Chad's occasional disappearance ("truancy") from the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span>

fn.260 : PBS documentary broadcast @ 1996

fn.265 : novelization? @ 1994?

pp.319 - "..._heard_ the great Spiral Staircase _yawn_ beneath them..." « emphasis added »

fn.275 (pp.322-3) - Navidson : thinking about his family is what gets him back home; also: for him the Hallway is longer where for all others it was shorter (!?)

fn.276 (pp.327) [Truant] - "Re-inter this thing in a binding tomb.  Make it _only_ a book..."  « emphasize: "binding" and "only a book" - a story as a living thing? the book as its corpse? (see also: Neal Stephenson "gold is the corpse of value") »

pp.333 - "turns the camera on himself" [after all that discussion of suicide?]

fn.302 (pp.338) - "[Zampanò]'s trapped inside me..." (me = Truant [evidence for the theory that there is no Zampanò])

ref @ [Phalaris'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalaris) - brass ("brazen") bull
<br/> - <s>Minotaur</s>
<br/> - vessel for Truant?

when threatened by the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> : Karen retreats (flees? escapes?) into the "original" hallway (that connects Parents' to Children's room) - to escape the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> violence
