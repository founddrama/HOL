[friesel](http://blog.founddrama.net/) writ:

7/9 - XVIII.

(Karen goes after Navidson)

links to Jamestown?
<br/>- as if the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> or its <span style="border:1px solid #0000ee;padding:2px;">innerness</span> existed then or back _into_ then

pp.414 - "...as if to imply in a larger way that there are some places in this world which no one will ever possess or inhabit."

pp.417 - ends abruptly
<br/>↳ just before : discovering Navidson's effects (obviously [?] not there before)

(Karen &amp; Reston both find a shallow white closet where once there was The Hallway)

but Karen stays and the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> "regurgitates" evidence of Navidson (!?)
<br/>↳ "regurgitates" -- into the children's room and then that is where the <span style="color:#0000ee;">house</span> _opens up_ to consume (??) her (again) [Karen never went in]
