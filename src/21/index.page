7/10 - XXI.

<div align="center" style="padding:20px;margin:20px;border:1px solid #0000ee;">it's all Truant</div>

- "Lude's dead." (first time I read this ['01?] it send shivers down my spine)

pp.492 : "no Little Round Top"
<br/>- @todo - Gettysburg? (why Gettysburg? why _that_ reference?)

@todo - noted despite the text's many mutations : pg. #s remain the same (same place, same style)

pp.496 - "...I craved the pain, and the knowledge pain bestows..."

(why Virginia?)

« hallucinating health and happiness »

pp.509 - a smear of blood on the page? (do you see it to? or is that my blood?)

@todo - ecdysiast?

How did Truant get the book online?
