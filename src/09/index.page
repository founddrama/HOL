title: House of Leaves- Chapter IX

<a href="http://blog.founddrama.net/">friesel</a> writ:

7/5 - IX.

open w/ schizophrenic footnotes -- of which ~ the 1st terminus informs the whole joke (?)

@begin discuss:
	- Labyrinth
	- minotaur

<s>Why cross out everything to do w/ the Labyrinth &amp; Minotaur?</s>

<s>2 pointers to footnote 129 (!?)</s> -- _practically of no consequence_ i.e., &amp; many more circular references follow

(pp. 119) -- -- the block <span style="border:1px solid #0000ee;padding:5px;width:50%;">aside(s?)</span>
	↳ (thru pp. 141) -- the pt. of which seems to underscore how featureless the whole space is -- (Except for the staircase [it has 2 newell posts] -- and how did I ever miss that before now?)
		↳ also : <s>"Picture that.  In your dreams."
			↳ also : ALSO : (the <span style="border:1px solid #0000ee;padding:5px;">block aside</span> _is_ the staircase [!?])

<div align="right" style="margin:20px;padding:20px;border:1px solid #0000ee;">
	<u>NOTED:</u> foornotes : 146-148? _also_ the staircase?
	
	<u>pp. 121</u> "Therefore the question soon arises whether or not it is someone's house.  Though if so whose?  Whose was it or even whose _is_ it?"
	
	FURTHER consider : these footnotes (144) &amp; <span style="border:1px dashed #0000ee;">146-148</span> help to _define_ &amp; _limit_ the geometry of the pages ahead &amp; so to guide you but also to box you in (?)
</div>

pp. 122 : "a sign of [his] deepening atrabilious obsession with the unpresent."

(Jed &amp; Wax decide : return w/o Holloway)

tedious
	exhausting
		frightening
